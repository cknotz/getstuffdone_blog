**Hi!**

My name is Carlo and I teach political science, including data analysis, at the [University of Stavanger](https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/carlo-michael-knotz-0) in Norway.

I often find that students have quite smart ideas that they want to test in a course paper or thesis project and which *could* be tested with a relatively simple quantitative analysis -- but they don't know how to actually go about this (and might also be intimidated by quantitative methods/coding).

The aim of this blog is to show these students how they can **test big ideas** -- e.g., about the role of class, social norms, political institutions, or gender -- **with relatively simple methods** that they should be familiar with from their introductory statistics course and with the free and open-source `R` statistical programming language.

The posts are very much focussed on explaining the general logic of an analysis and assume that readers are at least a bit familiar with the basic of statistics and data analysis methods and how to work with `R`. Each post also gives pointers to more advanced resources (textbooks, journal articles) on quantitative methods.
