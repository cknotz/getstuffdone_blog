# Testing Big Ideas with Simple Methods

Many students have grand ideas about politics or society â€” but they don't quite know how to actually test them in an empirical analysis. 
Often, the problem seems to be that they think they need to do something very complicated, similar to what "adult" researchers publish in academic journal articles. 

But this is wrong: **Many big ideas can be tested with simple methods**. I've started a blog to show how this can be done using `R`: https://cknotz.github.io/getstuffdone_blog/.
