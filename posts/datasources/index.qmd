## Forests and trees

Finding relevant data is one of the major hurdles which many students face during term paper or thesis projects --- which is a bit puzzling given that there is a *huge* and growing amount of data about many political, social, or economic aspects freely available on the open internet. 

This post provides a (definitely not exhaustive) list of datasets and data repositories that can be relevant for research projects in the social and political sciences. It is not the first such list (see below),  but it complements other lists with a stronger focus on datasets from and relevant for research on welfare states.

Links to most data sources are provided, those without links should be easy to find. The list and links are updated every once in a while.

## Other (better?) overviews over available data

Erik Gahner's excellent [*Dataset of Political Datasets*](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData){target="_blank"} provides a great overview over datasets that are relevant for political science research, and there are also a number of data repositories and archives that contain even more (and partly older) data that might be relevant for some projects, for example:

 - The [GESIS](http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/){target="_blank"} survey data repository for survey data
 - The Norwegian [Norsk senter for forskningsdata (NSD)](https://www.nsd.no/){target="_blank"} or [*Datafabrikken*](https://data.norge.no/nb){target="_blank"}.
